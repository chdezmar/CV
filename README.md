I am a graduate of Makers Academy, a 16 week full stack web development bootcamp in London. After getting a Bachelor's degree in Law and a Masters in Finance and Capital Markets, I started working for an Asset Management Company in Luxembourg. Attracted by uncertainty, I decided to go for something more exciting where I get challenged everyday.

Without any previous programming knowledge I learnt about Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, Version Control and a few programming languages and frameworks, leading to making cool [projects](#Projects) .


I am looking for a Junior Developer position to keep learning and growing with a dynamic company.

#### Fast learner

Comfortable with new technology. I like to think that I am able to quickly grasp new concepts, from very niche financial regulation in a foreign country to being able to use web sockets to create a [
fully functioning app]().

I enjoy working with different technologies, so while working on projects I always tried to be part of every feature that was implemented. I feel comfortable with approaching other people's code and the feeling of not understanding something at the beginning motivates me.


#### Team player

I am used to working with people in a business setting, as well as working with different timezones.

Pair programming has been a great learning tool for me. It always allows me to improve myself consistently through feedback by my peers.


#### Focused

I like systems that are well designed, integrated and simple.
For me, software development is about efficiency. Getting the most output from the minimum input is what attracted me to this career. I don't like just making things, I like to do things that make sense.
