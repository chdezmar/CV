I am a graduate at Makers Academy, a 16 week full stack development bootcamp in London. Without any previous programming knowledge I learnt about Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, Version Control and a few programming languages and frameworks, leading to making cool



I am looking for a Junior Developer position to keep learning while making something cool.

After getting a Bachelor's degree in Law and a Master in Finance and Capital Markets, I started working for an Asset Management Company in Luxembourg. Attracted by uncertainty, I decided to go for something more exciting.

#### Fast learner

Comfortable with new technology. I like to think that I am able to quickly grasp new concepts.

I enjoy working with different technologies, so while working on projects I always tried to be part of every feature that was implemented. I feel comfortable with approaching other people's code and the feeling of not understanding something at the beginning motivates me.

#### Focused

I like systems that are well designed, integrated and simple.
For me, software development is about efficiency. Getting the most output from the minimum input is what attracted me to this career. I don't like just making things, I like to do things that make sense.
